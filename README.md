## AI Model Information

The Training Data was taken from Kaggle and can be accessed here:

[Patient Health Scores for EHR data | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hansaniuma/patient-health-scores-for-ehr-data)



The Phython Notebook that was used for Training the Model on Google Colab is included in the /model folder. So is the Training Data itself.
